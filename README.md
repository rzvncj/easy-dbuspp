# easy-dbuspp

Modern C++ D-Bus wrapper.

## Introduction

The library has two major goals:

* Use regular, run-of-the-mill modern C++ and its standard types to abstract away almost all of D-Bus.
* Keep usage as simple as possible.

If a missing feature collides with these two goals, it will stay missing.

## Example usage

The library provides the `easydbuspp.h` convenience header, which brings in everything you need to start
using it.

Here's how we create a service:

```cpp
easydbuspp::session_manager session_manager {easydbuspp::bus_type_t::SESSION, "org.gtk.GDBus.Test"};
easydbuspp::object object {session_manager, "org.gtk.GDBus.TestInterface", "/org/gtk/GDBus/TestObject"};
```

The second parameter to `session_manager`'s constructor is the bus name. Then we create an object which
uses the `session_manager` instance, with a given interface name and a D-Bus object path.

### Registering methods

Registering a method with the D-Bus `object` is as simple as using `object::add_method()` with the
method name and a callable entity (lambda, functor object, regular function pointer).

```cpp
object.add_method("MethodTakingAStringAndReturningBool",
                  [](const std::string& input) {
                      return input == "password";
                  });
```

That's it! Now whenever something calls `MethodTakingAStringAndReturningBool` via D-Bus, the
library automatically invokes your lambda and does all the legwork of packing the returned
value and sending it back to the caller. You don't have to know anyting else!

### Reporting errors

Errors are simply reported by throwing an `std::exception`-derived exception. For example, say
we don't want to accept empty strings as input to `MethodTakingAStringAndReturningBool`:

```cpp
object.add_method("MethodTakingAStringAndReturningBool",
                  [](const std::string& input) {
                      if (input.empty())
                          throw std::runtime_error("No empty input strings allowed!");
                      return input == "password";
                  });
```

Again, that's it! The exception will simply be picked up by the library and converted into an
error that's sent back, via the D-Bus wire, to the caller!

### Adding properties

D-Bus' properties can be read-only, read-write, and read-only. The library will figure out
what type a property is based on the type of the value provided (literals, `const`s, will be
read-only properties automatically, while lvalues will be read-write properties
automatically).

```cpp
// Read-only property, because 42 is an int literal.
object.add_property("TheAnswerToLifeTheUniverseAndEverything", 42);

const double PI {3.1415};
// Read-only property, because add_property() sees a const value.
object.add_property("ReadOnlyDoubleProp", PI);

// Read only property, because this decays to a const char*.
object.add_property("GreatestPhilosopher", "Ludwig Wittgenstein");

// Read-write property, because readwrite_str is seen as an lvalue.
std::string readwrite_str {"This value can be modified"};
object.add_property("ReadWriteStringProp", readwrite_str);
```

Properties can also be registered by providing setter and getter callbacks.

### Starting the service

Now that our object has been set up, we can make it available by starting the main processing loop:

```cpp
session_manager.run();
```

This plugs `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` in, so doing `^C` in your terminal will shut down gracefully.

And that's it! You can introspect and use your shiny new D-Bus object with one of a variety of
command line or GUI tools:

* [d-spy](https://apps.gnome.org/Dspy/)
* [qtdbusviewer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qdbusviewer.html)
* [gdbus](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/gdbus.1.html)

### Proxies: the other side of the coin

Now that we have a service up and running, we can connect to it using `easydbuspp::proxy`.

Here's how to set one up:

```cpp
easydbuspp::session_manager session_manager {easydbuspp::bus_type_t::SESSION};
easydbuspp::proxy           proxy(session_manager, "org.gtk.GDBus.Test", "org.gtk.GDBus.TestInterface",
                                  "/org/gtk/GDBus/TestObject");
```

### Calling a method

Calling methods is, well, easy. Just specify the return type you're expecting as the template
parameter to `proxy::call()`, then the method name as the first parameter, followed by all the
parameters the function expects:

```cpp
// Result will be a bool.
auto result = proxy.call<bool>("MethodTakingAStringAndReturningBool", "password");
```

### Handling errors

Remember our method threw an `std::runtime_error` if it's parameter was an empty string?
Well, that is magically turned into an `std::runtime_error` on the proxy side, so all we
have to do to handle errors is enclose our `call()` in a `try / catch` block:

```cpp
try {
    auto result = proxy.call<bool>("MethodTakingAStringAndReturningBool", "");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << "\n";
}
```

Getting the hang of the "easy" part of easy-dbuspp?
